			<h2>About LOUIS</h2>
			<p>LOUIS is the UNC Library intranet that employees can access to find information.  Employees significantly rely on LOUIS to complete everyday tasks for their job. However, most employees believe that LOUIS is incredibly difficult to navigate.</p>
			<p>To identify usability issues with the Libraries' internal SharePoint intranet, we conducted a study with multiple iterations: a tree test, a card sort, and then a follow-up tree test. </p>
			<h2>Participants</h2>
			<p>Thus, we recruited any UNC Libraries employees, including full time employees and student employees. To conduct this test, we divided this test into three segments. </p>
			<p>I created flyers for the tree tests and included a Go UNC link to promote the test. We posted them in locations where library staff would easily see the flyers.</p>

			<p>I created another flyer for the card sort to recruit participants. Our team also sent recruitment emails. Participants responded if they were interested. In addition, we set up a room in which participants stopped by for the card sort test. At the test site, we provided refreshments from Panera.</p>
