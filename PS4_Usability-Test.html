			<h2>Usability Test</h2>
				<p>To identify current problems within the PS4 app, I hired testers from UserTesting to test the current app. For this test, I set up a draft account so that the testers could experience the full process of logging in. Overall, I had three different testers complete ten different tasks. The tasks include a wide range of interactions with the PS4 app, ranging from logging out of the app to adding a friend in the PS4 app.</p>
				<h3>Analysis</h3>
				<p>From the testersâ€™ feedback, I identified the following problems with the current PS4 app:</p>
					<p>1. Downloading a separate app for messaging is confusing.</p>
					<p>2. Unclear language about denying a friend request.</p>
					<p>3. Unclear path to log out feature.</p>
				<h3>Recommendations</h3>
				<p>Thus, to address these issues, I planned to implement the following features:</p>
					<p>1. Create a Messaging feature within the app.</p>
					<p>2. Change language to clarify actions around friend requests.</p>
					<p>3. Move log out feature to profile.</p>
				<h3>Goals and Metrics</h3>
				<p>My goal for this test was to identify potential user problems within the UI. My testers did not specifically provide feedback about slow updates for games. However, I did not ask them to complete a task to download a game because that could take hours. I wanted the tests to be brief. Thus, I considered the update problem out of the scope for this test.</p>
				<p>Although I did not conduct a follow up usability test due to time constraints, I identified two metrics for success for the app. First, I will measure user satisfaction with messaging. Second, I will measure the amount of time for users to log out of the app. </p>
