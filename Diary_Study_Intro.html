			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Imagine this scenario: You’re so frustrated with a product or service that you write an angry review immediately after the experience. However, you decide not to send it. Although corporations may not be pleased with this review, they can at least use the honest feedback to better their product. Let’s make the scenario even better. What if the company pays you to provide the honest feedback? The UNC UX team adopted this strategy to conduct a diary study.</p>
			<p><a href="https://library.unc.edu/places/">Places to Study</a> is an online tool that enables students to find the most suitable study space. Places to Study allows users to filter through search criteria, such as “comfortable furniture” or “standing desks.”</p>

			<p>We plan to redesign the Places to Study interface to increase usability. However, we wanted to start our process with identifying our users’ motivations, thoughts, and experiences for using Places to Study.</p>
			<h2>Methodology</h2>
			<h3>Moderators</h3>
			<p>I served as the primary moderator for this test.</p>
			<h3>Participants</h3>
			<p>For this test, we decided to focus on undergraduate students. Originally, we sought to recruit fifteen participants. Diary study research shows that normally thirty percent of participants leave the study before completion. My goal was to recruit fifteen participants in hope that at least ten would complete the study. I confirmed thirteen participants for the study.</p>
			<h3>Diaries</h3>
			<p>In diary studies, participants can keep an electronic or physical diary. We opted for the electronic format for easier analysis. Thus, I created surveys that included the diary study prompts. I sent a survey to users each day and they responded.</p>
			<p>Originally, we planned for the surveys to expire at the end of each day. However, I noticed that many participants forgot to respond at least once. We prioritized collecting user data. Therefore, we decided to extend the expiration date to the end of the week. Also, we established a one hundred word count. Participants did not always meet the word requirement.</p>
			<h3>Briefing Sessions</h3>
			<p>Prior to the study, we conducted preliminary briefing meetings in which we outlined the study for participants. In this meeting, we gave participants a ten dollar Amazon gift card for joining the study. Also, participants signed the consent forms in this meeting. Finally, we asked them a few preliminary questions about their study habits.</p>
			<h3>Incentives</h3>
			<p>At the end of each week, participants received a $20 Amazon gift card. The total incentive amount was $50 in Amazon gift cards.</p>
			<h3>Data Privacy</h3>
			<p>To maintain privacy, we assigned each participant a randomly generated number. Thus, the participants’ responses did not directly correlate to their identity. Also, we stored the participant responses separately from the other preliminary information. </p>
