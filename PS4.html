			<h2>Time is Key</h2>
			<p>In my Usability Design course, our professor tasked us with creating an app based on a “How might we” question. I’m an avid PS4 player. Thus, I thought of the following design thinking question:</p>
			<strong class="center">“How might we reduce the amount of time it takes to update the PlayStation 4?”</strong>
			<h3>Idea Pitch</h3>
			<p>When I log in to my PS4, I spend a significant amount of time sitting and waiting. Also, if I did not complete an update, then I must wait a long time. Sometimes, this delay lasts for hours. Consequently, I propose a design that allows users to log into the PS4 remotely.</p>
			<p>I propose an app update that expedites the PS4 login process by introducing a remote start feature. In this update, people can start their Playstation remotely so that they do not have to wait for the login screen. Also, users can start updates so that they do not prolong their gameplay.</p>
