			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>In my Usability Design course, we conducted a semester long project to redesign the WRAL website. WRAL is a local news network that serves the greater Triangle area. WRAL was not officially our client. Consequently, we conducted this project as a mock project for a specific client. Members from WRAL visited our class a few times. Thus, we were able to talk with WRAL to shape project requirements.</p>
			<h2>Phase One</h2>
			<h3>Usability Test</h3>
			<p>First, we conducted a usability test to measure ease of use for the WRAL website. I participated in this phase with a team of five other graduate students. My role on this team was writing the test script.</p> 
			<p>We had twelve people participate in the study. We used a convenience sample to conduct the test with people that we knew. In the test sessions, we introduced the test and required participants to sign a consent form. Afterwards, we asked participants to complete the following tasks: </p>
				<p>For the first task, where would you click to find NBC shows?</p>
				<p>Next, where would you click first to find the weather forecast for the next seven days?</p>
				<p>Using this
				website’s navigation, locate this week’s NC Lottery drawings.</p>
				<p>Use this website’s
				navigation and locate Out & About TV’s September 2019 video.</p>
				<p>Using this website and the navigation bar, find 2 movies offered this weekend at the AMC
				Theater at Southpoint.</p>
				<p>Please show me how you would find a
				weather forecast video on the WRAL website.</p>
				<p>Imagine you are on the WRAL website and decide that you want to see what videos are
				live on their Facebook by accessing it through the website. Please show me how you would do this.</p>
				<p>You want to share an editorial from WRAL.com on Twitter. Please show me how you
				would do that.</p>
				<p>Imagine you have recently heard about a WRAL Nascar related podcast. Please find the
				podcast. Then select an episode and start listening to it.</p>
			<p>From this test, we identified three major problems: First, we learned that most users were confused with the navigation’s sub items. Second, we found that our users were confused by language on the website unless they were already familiar with WRAL. Finally, we found that finding the social media icons on the home page was neither easy nor intuitive for users.</p>
			<h2>Phase Two</h2>
			<h3>Persona</h3>
			<p>After analyzing the usability test results, I created a persona to represent different user types. In addition to the tests in Phase 1, I conducted two interviews to inform the personas. From my interviews, I learned that there are users who frankly do not care about events in the local community. Thus, I identified Tyler the Transplant as a persona.</p>

			<p>Figure 1: Tyler the Transplant Persona</p>
			<p>The Triangle area is home to numerous transplants, including myself, that do not have a lot of knowledge about the triangle area. Thus, Tyler does not have a devout allegiance to the area and might be critical initially. Also, The Tyler’s information needs are different from the resident local to the triangle area. Primarily, Tyler is significantly interested in learning the best places in the local area and monitoring travel for when Tyler needs to leave the area. You can download a PDF copy of the persona here. </p>
			<h2>Phase Three</h2>
			<h3>Structure</h3>
			<p>My proposed design structure combines the WRAL assets into six user paths. My design is based on three design principles from Nielsen Norman Group. First, I used the Aesthetic and Minimalist Design principle to reduce cognitive load for the users. Thus, there are only six primary categories in the menu structure.</p>

			<p>Next, I used the Plain Language principle for category titles so that users could understand the significance of the category. Then, I used the Flexibility and Ease of Use design principle because I wanted paths that had an understandable differentiation. Furthermore, I hope that the six category design enables users to start on the right path sooner.</p>
			<h3>Journey Map</h3>
			<p>In this phase, I also created a Journey Map. In my persona, I mentioned that Tyler frequently checks WRAL for flights. Thus, I chose this scenario for my primary task in the journey map. When I outlined Tyler’s actions, I considered the places where Tyler would stumble in the process.</p>
