			<h2>Target Audience</h2>
				<p>The main target audience for the app is Playstation 4 users. PS4 users derive from all ages, backgrounds, and abilities. According to Statista, there are currently 94 million PS4 players today. Thus, the target audience will have a vast number of user needs. I outlined the following target demographics:</p>
			<h2>Personas</h2>
				<p>To construct the personas, I conducted two user interviews. I used a convenience sample to find people who were online gamers. I included people who play other gaming systems to consider needs that were not exclusive to PS4. Afterwards, I created two personas. </p> 
				<h3>Casual Cassie</h3>
				<p>My first persona, Casual Cassie, represents a more infrequent gamer. 
				Cassie plays PS4 casually on the weekends. Cassie is very passionate about expanding the identity 
				of gamers to be more inclusive towards women. Thus, Cassie is a member of a female gamer group 
				and participates in the groupâ€™s events. Cassie could use this proposed app to maximize the
				amount of time for gaming.</p>

				<h3>Gerald the Gamer</h3>
				<p>My second persona, Gerald the Gamer, represents a passionate, avid gamer. Gerald plays PS4 
				every day after work. Gerald strives to show that gamers are not one dimensional people. 
				Therefore, Gerald participates in numerous activities outside of gaming. On the contrary, Gerald 
				is significantly involved in the gamer community and often watches YouTube videos about gaming. </p>
