			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>For our semester long class project, our team decided to focus on an application that is local to the UNC community. Thus, we decided on NextBus. Based on personal experience, we know that many students rely on NextBus to travel to UNCâ€™s campus. NextBus is a mobile transit application that allows users to find the next available option to travel to their destination. This application is available on iOS and Android platforms.</p>
			<h2>System Overview</h2>
			<p>To start this project, we analyzed the NextBus system.</p>
			<h3>System Description</h3>
			<p>The NextBus mobile application is an Android / iOS system that allows users to track and
			plan their bus commutes by connecting and displaying data sourced from the NextBus
			GPS vehicle tracking system. NextBus Inc. owns and operates the satellite positioning
			systems that generates vehicle position data in realtime.</p>
			<p>The NextBus group also maintains and produces the client-facing NextBus mobile and
			desktop applications. The NextBus mobile app displays both static data (bus routes and
			operating lines) and real-time data (arrival time, delays, bus location) with the aim of
			reducing the reliance on static schedules while minimizing wait times.</p>
			<h3>Project Scope</h3>
			<p>In working to redesign the UI of the NextBus app, our primary objective is to enhance the daily experience of fellow students who share the Chapel Hill Transit system. More specifically, we are looking for ways to improve accessibility, lessen the learning curve
			for first-time users, and identify possible modifications and new features that unlock a
			more personalized experience. By incorporating user preferences, the application can
			provide more relevant commuting solutions.</p>
