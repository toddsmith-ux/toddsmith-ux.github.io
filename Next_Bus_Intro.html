			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>For our semester long class project, our team decided to focus on an application that is local to the UNC community. Thus, we decided on NextBus. Based on personal experience, we know that many students rely on NextBus to travel to UNC’s campus. NextBus is a mobile transit application that allows users to find the next available option to travel to their destination. This application is available on iOS and Android platforms.</p>
			<h2>System Overview</h2>
			<p>To start this project, we analyzed the NextBus system.</p>
			<h3>System Description</h3>
			<p>The NextBus mobile application is an Android / iOS system that allows users to track and
			plan their bus commutes by connecting and displaying data sourced from the NextBus
			GPS vehicle tracking system. NextBus Inc. owns and operates the satellite positioning
			systems that generates vehicle position data in realtime.</p>
			<p>The NextBus group also maintains and produces the client-facing NextBus mobile and
			desktop applications. The NextBus mobile app displays both static data (bus routes and
			operating lines) and real-time data (arrival time, delays, bus location) with the aim of
			reducing the reliance on static schedules while minimizing wait times.</p>
			<h3>Project Scope</h3>
			<p>In working to redesign the UI of the NextBus app, our primary objective is to enhance the daily experience of fellow students who share the Chapel Hill Transit system. More specifically, we are looking for ways to improve accessibility, lessen the learning curve
			for first-time users, and identify possible modifications and new features that unlock a
			more personalized experience. By incorporating user preferences, the application can
			provide more relevant commuting solutions.</p> 
			<h2>Target Audience</h2>
			<h3>Demographics</h3>
			<p>The NextBus app is targeted at people who rely on the Chapel Hill Transit System, specifically those who wish to obtain additional information about bus information
			beyond the information available at bus stops (i.e. paper schedules and electronic
			billboards). The age of users ranges between 10-90, from young children traveling with their own smart phone to seniors who have decades of experience relying on the bus system prior to the introduction of NextBus.</p>
			<p>As NextBus is a technology that accompanies a public service, the accessibility profile
			varies tremendously. This audience requirement has implications in the design of the
			NextBus mobile app; specifically, the features available and usability of those features
			must accommodate those with visual, audio, motor, and psychological impairments.</p>
			<h3>User Motivations</h3>
			<p>In terms of motivations, we note that users use the NextBus mobile application either 1)
			before arriving at the target bus stop or 2) to confirm any discrepancies in a bus arrival
			time, usually as a result of delay. Those in the first group often wish to avoid long wait
			times at the bus stop and therefore have a focus on timing the arrival of the bus exactly.
			Users in the second group are physically present at the bus stop but use NextBus mobile
			to understand how much longer they must wait, why they may be experiencing a delay,
			or select an alternative route “on the fly” that better suits their travel.</p>
			<h3>Personas</h3>
			<p>To represent our target audience, we created three personas:</p>
			<h4>Persona 1</h4>
			<img src="../images-NextBus/Frank_the_Freshman_1.png" alt="Frank the Freshman Persona" class="center">
			<p>Figure 1: Frank the Freshman Persona</p>
			<p>This persona represents a UNC student who uses NextBus to travel to class. </p>
			<h4>Persona 2</h4>
			<img src="../images-NextBus/Patricia_the_Photographer_2.png" alt="Patricia the Photographer Persona" class="center">
			<p>Figure 2: Patricia the Photographer Persona</p>
			<p>This persona represents a UNC staff member who uses NextBus to travel to work.</p>
			<h4>Persona 3</h4>
			<img src="../images-NextBus/Retired_Racquel_1.png" alt="Retried Racquel Persona" class="center">
			<p>Figure 3: Retired Racquel Persona</p>
			<p>This persona represents a community member who uses NextBus to travel around town. </p>
