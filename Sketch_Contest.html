			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Imagine the following scenario: someone schedules a meeting for business. When they walk into the door, instead of meeting agendas, they hand out markers and paper. Then, they instruct you to draw. I would argue that you would feel relieved that you do not have to exhaust your mental energy on today’s meeting topic. I also would predict that you would be happy to experiment with art, even if you do not love to draw.</p>
			<p>We tested this hypothesis by hosting a sketch contest. We asked students to sketch their ideal library website. We noticed how much our participants enjoyed taking a break in their day to draw a picture and relax. Overall, we learned some valuable insights about user preferences for library websites.</p>
			<h2>Audience</h2>
			<p>UNC students were the primary target audience for our study. Any current UNC student could participate. Faculty and staff were not allowed to participate. We did not evaluate the drawings based on the skill of the artwork. We emphasized that we want to see how people think and not judge how they draw. For an incentive, we gave away five $10 Amazon gift cards. We conducted a random drawing of all participants to determine the gift card recipients.</p> 
			<p>Overall, we had 37 participants participate in the study. However, only half of the ten tasks received under a fifty percent success rate. Consequently, we decided to research further because this number was lower than ideal.</p>
			<h2>Methodology</h2>
			<h3>Sketching</h3>
			<p>Sketch contests are considered exploratory user research. We were inspired by Portland State University’s sketch contest from 2017. Sketch contests are unique because they are self-moderated. Instead of acting as an active moderator in the test sessions, we basically had no role in the test execution. In addition, sketch contests are inexpensive to conduct. Thus, we highly recommend conducting a similar study for your organization.</p>
			<h3>Test Setup</h3>
			<p>Over a three day period, we set up a table in our lobby with the following supplies: markers, pencils, paper, and candy. We also displayed flyers on the table. When participants stopped by our table, we informed them about the study. If they consented to participate, then we had them sign the paperwork. To ensure participant privacy, we stored the drawings and consent documentation separately. After they completed the paperwork, we provided them with the materials and collected the drawings upon completion.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>We set a goal of twenty five participants to participate in the study. Overall, thirty five participants participated. Once we collected the drawings, we coded each feature and kept a total of the amount of times it appeared in a user’s drawing. For example, the UNC logo occurred the most throughout the drawings. The top five features throughout all of the drawings included the following:</p>
			<li>UNC Libraries logo</li>
			<li>Search Bar</li>
			<li>Events section</li>
			<li>Hours</li>
			<li>News</li>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>The biggest takeaway from this study is that almost everyone expects different features for a homepage. Thus, you will experience difficulty if you try to create a website that matches all user preferences. To navigate this paradox, you can identify some of the most important features and implement them. Ultimately, we consider this study a success and hope to implement new features in the future. To end this post, I wanted to showcase some of the sketches that students submitted.</p>
