			<h2>Target Audience</h2>
			<h3>Demographics</h3>
			<p>The NextBus app is targeted at people who rely on the Chapel Hill Transit System, specifically those who wish to obtain additional information about bus information
			beyond the information available at bus stops (i.e. paper schedules and electronic
			billboards). The age of users ranges between 10-90, from young children traveling with their own smart phone to seniors who have decades of experience relying on the bus system prior to the introduction of NextBus.</p>
			<p>As NextBus is a technology that accompanies a public service, the accessibility profile
			varies tremendously. This audience requirement has implications in the design of the
			NextBus mobile app; specifically, the features available and usability of those features
			must accommodate those with visual, audio, motor, and psychological impairments.</p>
			<h3>User Motivations</h3>
			<p>In terms of motivations, we note that users use the NextBus mobile application either 1)
			before arriving at the target bus stop or 2) to confirm any discrepancies in a bus arrival
			time, usually as a result of delay. Those in the first group often wish to avoid long wait
			times at the bus stop and therefore have a focus on timing the arrival of the bus exactly.
			Users in the second group are physically present at the bus stop but use NextBus mobile
			to understand how much longer they must wait, why they may be experiencing a delay,
			or select an alternative route “on the fly” that better suits their travel.</p>
			<h3>Personas</h3>
			<p>To represent our target audience, we created three personas:</p>
			<h4>Persona 1</h4>
			<img src="../images-NextBus/Frank_the_Freshman_1.png" alt="Frank the Freshman Persona" class="center">
			<p>Figure 1: Frank the Freshman Persona</p>
			<p>This persona represents a UNC student who uses NextBus to travel to class. </p>
			<h4>Persona 2</h4>
			<img src="../images-NextBus/Patricia_the_Photographer_2.png" alt="Patricia the Photographer Persona" class="center">
			<p>Figure 2: Patricia the Photographer Persona</p>
			<p>This persona represents a UNC staff member who uses NextBus to travel to work.</p>
			<h4>Persona 3</h4>
			<img src="../images-NextBus/Retired_Racquel_1.png" alt="Retried Racquel Persona" class="center">
			<p>Figure 3: Retired Racquel Persona</p>
			<p>This persona represents a community member who uses NextBus to travel around town. </p>
