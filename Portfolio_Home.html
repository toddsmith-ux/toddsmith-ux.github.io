				<p class="intro">PS4 App Redesign</p>
				<p id="details4">This redesign was a response to a design thinking challenge for class. 
				I focused on the primary question: “how might we reduce the amount of time that PS4 users 
				spend waiting for games to update?” To answer this question, I proposed a 
				<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/ps4/app/">PS4</a> app redesign that enabled users 
				to remote start game updates. This project occurred in Fall 2019. To learn more about this project, 
				visit this <a href="https://toddsmith-ux.github.io/PS4.html">page</a>. </p>

				<p class="intro">WRAL Redesign</p>
				<p id="details6">This redesign was a class project that simulated a client project. 
				In other words, although I did not have a contract with <a href="https://www.wral.com/">WRAL</a>, 
				WRAL stakeholders still visited our class and engaged in the design process. Our class conducted a 
				usability test to inform our proposed redesign. This project occurred in Fall 2019.

				<p class="intro">NextBus App Redesign</p>
				<p id="details3">For my User Interface Design class, myself and a teammate redesigned the 
				<a href="https://www.nextbus.com/#!/sf-muni/E/E____I_F00/4532/4503">NextBus</a> app. 
				We focused on design problems in the user interface and conducted research to solve the problem. 
				Afterwards, we proposed a new design to address these issues. This project occurred in Spring 2019.
