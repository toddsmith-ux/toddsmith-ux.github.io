			<h2>Usability Test</h2>
			<h3>Prototype</h3>
			<p>I created a prototype using Adobe XD. You can access the prototype <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/b089a11e-b4e0-491a-681e-786a73283bda-c6b8/?hints=off">here</a>.</p>
			<h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
			<p>After creating the prototype, we conducted a small contextual inquiry to survey users about their impressions of NextBus. Out of the users we surveyed, three of them were active NextBus users and one was new to the platform. Each user met face-to-face with a team member, and were shown the existing NextBus mobile application.</p>
			<p>First, we asked them about their general impressions of the application. 
			Then, we asked the users about issues and desired changes to existing functionality.  
			Next we asked users to complete the following tasks:</p> 
			<ul>
				<li class="center">1. Find specific route and accompanying map</li>
				<li class="center">2. Edit application settings</li>
				<li class="center">3. Set a frequent destination</li>
			</ul> 
			<p>Afterwards, we showed the users our prototype and asked them about their impressions. 
			Since this is a small study, we acknowledge that we cannot draw any generalizations from this test. 
			From the contextual inquiry, we learned the following insights: Strengths of the redesign include the 
			simplification of navigation flow and the comprehensiveness of user profile</p>
			<p>Weaknesses included the order of menu buttons and the lack of support features for new users. 
			For individuals who were active NextBus users, their existing preferences and habits affected their statements.
			As an example, combining the map view and list view to form the primary navigation flow was highly supported 
			by the comments of some active users, while others did not find any improvement as they did not use the 
			map at all.</p>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>From this experience, I believe the changes that we implemented will improve usability for the user. 
			The most important lesson I learned from this experience is the value of cognitive load. 
			When users navigate a user interface, they only need to know the see the essential information. 
			Thus, cognitive load can make or break a userâ€™s experience. 
			If a user finds it mentally taxing to use an app, then they will not use the app. </p>
