				<h2>Phases</h2>
				<h3>Phase One</h3>
				<p>In June 2019, we mapped out the current structure of  LOUIS. Afterwards, we implemented the structure in a tree test using Optimal Workshop. We wanted to answer the following question: can UNC library employees currently find where documents are located in the current LOUIS architecture? The answer would determine whether or not we would conduct further testing.</p> 
				<p>Therefore, we sent out a tree test via Optimal Workshop. The test included ten tasks that were optional. Participants could abandon the test at any time. We posted a link to the tree test on flyers and posted them across the libraries.</p>

				<p>Figure 1: Preliminary Tree Test</p>
				<p>Overall, we had 37 participants participate in the study. However, only half of the ten tasks received under a fifty percent success rate. Consequently, we decided to research further because this number was lower than ideal. 
				</p>
				<h3>Phase Two</h3>
				<p>In July 2019, we conducted a card sort with UNC library employees. We wanted to discuss in depth how UNC employees would organize LOUIS. To start the test design, the UNC UX team conducted a preliminary card sort among ourselves. This process allowed us to solidify the range of cards to include in the test. We decided on forty cards for each test.</p>

				<p>Figure 2: UX Team Conducts Card Sort</p>
				<p>Once we completed this step, we scheduled times with participants to conduct the card sort. We used Optimal Workshop to create the cards. We used the open card sort method. Participants could write in names of categories and areas that the participants thought were excluded.</p>
				<p>For the final step in Phase 2, the team analyzed the test results and proposed solutions. Optimal Workshop includes a barcode and card number that helps with data entry. After the data was entered, Each team member identified the most aggregated structure that they believed represented the results. Then, the team studied the participantsâ€™ responses collaboratively. </p>
				<h3>Phase Three</h3>
				<p>Once the team agreed upon a structure, we sent out another tree test to measure if our proposed changes were successful. We used Optimal Workshop again and sent out promotional flyers and emails. After the new results, about sixty percent of the tasks had a success rate of sixty five percent or higher.</p>

				<p>Figure 3: Post Tree Test</p>
				<p>We introduced a new concept that we believe will require some training: The Vault. The design idea behind the Vault is to place unnecessary documents into an archive and remove them from SharePoint folders. Each department will have a space in the Vault to keep their documents. The team plans to recommend a timeline to specify when an outdated document should move to the vault (e.g. if the department has not updated the document in two years). Once we train employees about the Vault, we anticipate that the results will improve for this menu change.</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The primary change was the new aggregated categories and reorganization of the submenu options.</p>
				<p>From our card sorting activity, we learned that many UNC library employees believed the titles for some of the menu and submenu options were ambiguous: they had no idea what they meant. Thus, we changed the titles of some of the categories to reflect more of a personal relationship between the categories and the users. Also, we reorganized the submenu options based on our card sort research. </p>
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>From our user testing, we identified a few user problems with the current LOUIS infrastructure:</p>
				<h3>User Problems</h3>
				<p>1. Most users do not know why the current information architecture exists in LOUIS</p>
				<p>2. Most users have no idea about the purpose for some of the documents in LOUIS</p>
				<p>3. User needs are more tailored to job duties</p>
				<p>4. Users often belonged in two categories: extreme users or infrequent users</p>
				<h3>Our Next Steps</h3>
				<p>Thus, we are planning the following steps to implement a new design and improve LOUIS for employees: </p>
				<p>1. Create a new front facing interface for LOUIS that enhances the UI for displaying library news and events</p>
				<p>2. Investigate implementing a new SharePoint theme to improve the UI</p>
				<p>3. Implementing the new SharePoint architecture into the live site </p>
