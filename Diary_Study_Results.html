			<h2>Analysis</h2>
			<h3>Diary Study Prompts</h3>
			<p>We sent the following prompts to participants each day, in this order:</p>
			<ol>
			<p>1. What is your favorite study space on campus? Describe why you love it.</p>
			<p>2. Where is one place that you study that others might consider an unconventional study space?</p>
			<p>3. Describe how you would find a new study space without using the library’s Places to Study tool.</p>
			<p>4. If you could design the perfect study space, then what would you include in the design?</p>
			<p>5. Think about the past week. Which study spaces did you visit and why?</p>
			<p>6. Identify one word that describes your past/current experience with the library’s Places to Study tool. Explain why you chose this word.</p>
			<p>7. Upload a picture that reflects your feelings towards the library’s Places to Study tool. Explain why you chose this picture.</p>
			<p>8. Upload two pictures. The first should represent your thoughts before using the Places to Study tool. The second should reflect your thoughts after using the Places to Study tool. Write a paragraph to explain your reasoning.</p>
			<p>9. Describe how you would explain the Places to Study tool to someone who had never used a computer before.</p>
			<p>10. If the Places to Study tool were a person and you were writing a breakup letter to it, what would you say in the letter?</p>
			<h3>Coding</h3>
			<p>Due to the limited sample size, we cannot make any generalizable conclusions from this study. However, we identified salient points from the participants’ responses. We coded the data using NVivo via the UNC Virtual Lab. We used open coding to create the categories. In the responses, we referenced remarks to the respective categories.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Overall, I noticed a few trends in participants responses:</p>
				<p>Many participants did not discover the Places to Study tool until much later in the process. At that point, they already knew about their preferred places.</p>
				<p>Participants believed that Places to Study did not capture real time data.</p>
				<p>Participants wanted more mobile capabilities.</p>
				<p>Overall, the atmosphere of the space (furniture, noise level) was one of the most important factors in deciding which space to use.</p>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>From conducting this study, I learned a few tips for the future:</p>
				<p>College students respond to surveys at all times of the night. Therefore, do not implement an expiration if you are using a virtual method.</p>
				<p>Electronic diary studies can lose the contextual information if participants are not writing in a physical diary while occupying a space.</p>
				<p>The word count should be revisited, depending on the quality of responses.</p>
				<p>Gift cards are not the best incentive because they do not allow researchers to provide a partial incentive.</p>
			<p>I hope to conduct another version of this study with graduate students.</p>
