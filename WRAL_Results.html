			<h2>Phase Four</h2>
			<h3>Wireframe</h3>
			<p>Overall, WRAL’s website is extremely cluttered. Consequently, the cognitive load is significantly high for the user to simply browse the site. Reading is often a taxing activity, especially in an age when users expect expediency. Thus, I decided to use a minimalist approach to focus on only the necessary items. For this deliverable, I created ten total wireframes. My proposed redesign centers all of the content into a grid format.</p>
			<p>Here's a sample of a wireframe:</p>

			<h3>Style Guide</h3>

			<p>Figure 5: Style Guide</p>
			<p>I created this style guide to apply to all of my panels. I wanted a color scheme that was easy for the eyes to view. Thus, I used a monochromatic scheme of blues. Also, I chose classic style serif fonts.</p>
			<h2>Phase Five</h2>
			<h3>Final Design</h3>
			<p>My redesign utilizes the white space as a border around the grid. The colour palette uses shades of blue to convey a tranquil, relaxing atmosphere on the site. The three colours in the banner represent the three components of the triangle. The font style is primarily Century; this font reminded me of a classic early 1900s vintage newspaper style.</p>

			<p>Figure 6: Final Home Page Panel</p>
			<p>For the navigation, this redesign uses six main options that users can click to find their desired information. These categories aspire to differentiate between each other so that users can know which path to start. </p>
			<p>My primary design inspiration was the New York Times. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> maintains a grid format across its homepage. Google’s centered search bar inspired this design. Also, <a href="https://www.chanel.com/us/">Chanel’s</a> minimalist design also inspired this design. Furthermore, the minimalist focus derives from these websites.</p>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Overall, I learned from this project that audience analysis is one of the most important factors in user interface design. Sites, such as WRAL, must appeal to a wide array of users. Thus, they must constantly conduct user testing to determine if there are new audience demographics or if their audience’s needs changed. Furthermore, this project further solidified that testing is an iterative process. </p>
